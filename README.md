## Project Overview

This project focuses on real-time **Vehicle Detection and Tracking** to enhance traffic flow analysis. Using advanced digital image processing techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of vehicle detection, classification, and tracking for efficient traffic monitoring.

Key features include:
- Detection and tracking of vehicles across predefined regions of interest.
- Classification of vehicles into four categories: Bicycles/Motorcycles, Cars, Pickup/Minibuses, and Buses/Trucks/Trailers.
- GUI for configuring parameters and visualizing results.

## Features

### 1. Vehicle Detection
- **Background Modeling**: Moving average method with Gaussian smoothing for robust background subtraction.
- **Noise Reduction**: Gaussian blur applied to grayscale frames.
- **Object Detection**: Contours and bounding boxes highlight detected vehicles.

### 2. Vehicle Tracking
- **Nearest Neighbor Approach**: Tracks vehicles between frames based on bounding box positions.
- **Dynamic ROI Selection**: Focuses detection within user-defined regions of interest.

### 3. Vehicle Classification
Classifies detected vehicles based on their size into:
- Type 1: Bicycle, Motorcycle
- Type 2: Car
- Type 3: Pickup, Minibus
- Type 4: Bus, Truck, Trailer

### 4. GUI
Interactive GUI features:
- Video clip selection
- Configurable parameters (e.g., ROI, area thresholds, skip steps)
- Real-time detection and visualization
